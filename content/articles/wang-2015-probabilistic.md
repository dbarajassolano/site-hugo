Wind and solar power generators are commonly described by a system of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) where random input parameters represent uncertainty in wind and solar energy.  The existing methods for SODEs are mostly limited to delta-correlated random parameters, while the uncertainties from renewable generation exhibit colored noises.  Here we use the probability density function (PDF) method, together with a novel large-eddy-diffusivity (LED) closure, to derive a closed-form deterministic partial differential equation (PDE) for the joint PDF of the SODEs describing a power generator with correlated-in-time power input.  The proposed LED accurately captures the effect of nonzero correlation time of the power input on systems described by a divergent stochastic drift velocity.  The resulting PDE is solved numerically.  The accuracy of the PDF method is verified by comparison with Monte Carlo simulations.
