I'm interested in developing efficient model inversion and uncertainty quantification methods for groundwater flow and reactive transport problems. I also work in developing multiscale and scientific machine learning-based models for these phenomena. Specific areas of interest include:

- Probabilistic, data-driven models of heterogeneous parameter fields.
- PDF methods for stochastic upscaling and uncertainty quantification.
- Bayesian methods for model inversion and data assimilation, including MCMC variants for high-dimensional problems, approximate Bayesian inference, likelihood-free, and others.
- Scientific machine learning methods for state estimation and parameter estimation.
- Multiscale schemes for continuum-scale groundwater flow and transport.
