I'm interested in developing efficient uncertainty quantification and model inversion methods for groundwater flow and reactive transport problems, and in developing multiscale/multiresolution schemes for the numerical approximation of continuum-scale models of these phenomena.  Specific areas of interest include:

- Probabilistic, data-driven models of heterogeneous parameter fields.
- PDF methods for stochastic upscaling and uncertainty quantification.
- Bayesian methods for model inversion, including MCMC variants for high-dimensional problems, approximate Bayesian inference, variational inference, and others.
- Scientific machine learning methods for state estimation and parameter estimation.
- Multiscale, multiresolution, and heterogeneous timestepping schemes for continuum-scale models of groundwater flow and transport.
