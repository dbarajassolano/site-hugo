title = "Stochastic differential and partial differential equations for uncertainty quantification"
+++

I'm interested in employing stochastic differential and partial differential equations for modeling physical systems with uncertain drivers and/or parameters. Specific topics include:

- PDF methods for the analysis of SDEs and hyperbolic SPDEs.
- Formulation and analysis of stochastic models of power transmission networks accounting for fluctuations in load and generation, including the study of large deviations.
- Scientific machine learning and sparse regression-based methods for uncertainty propagation and state estimation in SDEs and SPDEs.
