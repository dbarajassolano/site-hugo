I'm interested in developing scientific machine-learning (SciML) methods for forward and inverse problems in computational physics, particularly problems involving heterogeneous spatio-temporal parametric variability, high-dimensional parameter representations, and parametric uncertainty. Specific areas of interest include:

- Data-driven surrogate modeling.
- Dimension reduction.
- Physics-informed SciML under uncertainty.
- Uncertainty quantification in SciML.
