I'm interested in combining observation data and physics models such as PDEs to estimate unknown parameters of these physics models and other quantities of interest of the system being considered. Problems and areas of particular interest include:

- Sparse, indirect, and noisy observations in problems with highly heterogeneous, spatiotemporally distributed parameters.
- Bayesian methods for high-dimensional model inversion, including variants of MCMC for high-dimensional problems, sparse and approximate Bayesian inference, and variational inference, among others.
- Bayesian methods for data assimilation and state estimation based on Gaussian Process regression.
- Application to model inversion and data assimilation for groundwater flow and reactive transport problems.
