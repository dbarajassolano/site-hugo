I'm interested in combining observation data and numerical models of complex physical systems to estimate unknown parameters, perform probabilistic predictions of quantities of interest, and quantify the uncertainty in these predictions. Problems and areas of particular interest include:

- Sparse, indirect, and noisy observations in problems with highly heterogeneous, spatiotemporally distributed parameters.
- Bayesian methods for high-dimensional model inversion, including variants of MCMC for high-dimensional problems, likelihood-free inference, and variational inference, among others.
- Application to model inversion and data assimilation for groundwater flow and reactive transport problems.
