We present a probability density function (PDF) method for a system of nonlinear stochastic ordinary differential equations driven by colored noise.  The method provides an integrodifferential equation for the temporal evolution of the joint PDF of the system’s state, which we close by means of a modified large-eddy-diffusivity (LED) closure.  In contrast to the classical LED closure, the proposed closure accounts for advective transport of the PDF in the approximate temporal deconvolution of the integrodifferential equation.  In addition, we introduce the generalized local linearization approximation for deriving a computable PDF equation in the form of a second-order partial differential equation.  We demonstrate that the proposed closure and localization accurately describe the dynamics of the PDF in phase space for systems driven by noise with arbitrary autocorrelation time.  We apply the proposed PDF method to analyze a set of Kramers equations driven by exponentially autocorrelated Gaussian colored noise to study nonlinear oscillators and the dynamics and stability of a power grid.  Numerical experiments show the PDF method is accurate when the noise autocorrelation time is either much shorter or longer than the system’s relaxation time, while the accuracy decreases as the ratio of the two timescales approaches unity.  Similarly, the PDF method accuracy decreases with increasing standard deviation of the noise.
